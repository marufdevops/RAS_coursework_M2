# TiaGo Robot Navigation System with PDDL-based Path Planning
#
# This implementation uses a comprehensive PDDL-based navigation system supporting
# all 4 goals with the following features:
#
# - Expanded 11-node network with 16 weighted bidirectional connections
# - PDDL domain and problem generation for optimal path planning
# - Pyperplan integration with A* algorithm for shortest paths
# - Robust navigation controller with rotation and movement control
# - Path cost tracking and goal detection using goalchecker.py
# - 0.8m distance threshold for goal completion
# - Multi-goal support: balls, green, ducks, red
#
# Navigation Architecture:
# 1. Node Network: 11 predefined nodes with 16 weighted bidirectional connections
# 2. PDDL Planning: Generate domain/problem files and use pyperplan for optimal paths
# 3. Navigation Control: Follow planned path through nodes with cost tracking
# 4. Goal Detection: Use goalchecker.py to confirm target reached
#
# Usage: Type "balls", "green", "ducks", or "red" in the 3D view and press enter
# Expected Output: "Goal reached! Total distance covered: X.XX meters"
